<h3>Instructor</h3>
<p><a HREF="../_carette/index.html">
    Dr.  J. Carette</a>, ITB-168 , ext 26869, email: carette at mcmaster dot ca.
<p>Office hours: by appointment (or catch me after class).</p>
<h3>Teaching Assistants</h3>
<p>Ali Safilian (safiliaa), Nathan Collman (collmana), Mohamed Zayed (zayedmm), Wenqiang Chen (chenw25), Dillon Dixon (dixond2),
and Dylan Aspden (aspdendh)].</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>The calendar description says: <i>
Fundamental concepts of imperative programming (procedures, statements, control
structures, iteration, recursion, exceptions); basic data structures
(references, records, arrays, dynamic structures); basic concepts of operating
systems.
</i> 
</p>

<p>
The course provides a comprehensive coverage of the fundamental 
imperative programming
concepts. It provides students with a foundation that can be used to learn
many other languages (imperative and object-oriented alike).
By the end of this course students will be able to understand:
<ul>
	<li>recursion.</li>
	<li>functions, procedures and methods.</li>
	<li>the concept of an interface</li>
	<li>some principles of designing and writing well-documented and 
	    well-structured programs.</li>
	<li>some basic data-structures and algorithms.</li>
	<li>basic concepts of operating systems.</li>
</ul>
The course assumes familiarity with basic programming (as covered in
either CS 1MD3 or Eng 1D04).</p>

<h3>Textbooks</h3>

The following texbook will used extensively:
<ol>
	<li><b>Textbook:</b> Gilles Dowek, <i>Principles of Programming 
	Languages</i>, Springer UTiCS, ISBN: 978-1-84822-031-9.</li>
</ol>
While the next book is optional, if you need some extra Java information,
it is a good source.  It was used last year, and so used copies are easy
to find.
<ol start="2">
<li><b>Java guide:</b> Khalid A. Mughal, Torill Hamre, and Rolf W. Rasmussen. 
<i>Java Actually: A Comprehensive Primer in Programming</i>, Cengage Learning, 
ISBN: 978-1-84480-933-2.</li>
</ol>
We will use a style guide, to encourage good habits.  For that purpose,
the reference
<ol start="3">
<li><b>Style guide:</b> 
Allen Vermeulen, Scott W. Ambler, Greg Bumgardner, Eldon Metz, Trevor Misfeldt,
Jim Shur, and Patrick Thompson. <i>The Elements of Java Style</i>, 
Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-77768-1</li>
</ol>
<h3>Course Information on Web, and Slides</h3>
<p>The latest version of this outline, some of the hands out, and
details of the assignments can be 
found on the course web page
<tt>http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~se2s03</tt>
(Or go to my home page and then to the course page).</p>

<p>Announcements, assignment drop-boxes, discussion forums and other
items will all be posted on
<a href="../../avenue.mcmaster.ca/index.html">Avenue to learn</a>.
It is your responsibility to check Avenue frequently for course-related
information.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<h4>Assignments</h4>
<p>
There will be five full assignments, and one warm-up assignment.  The 
warm-up plus the
best four full assignments will count toward the final grade of the course,
plus some extra marks for those who hand in all five (exact formula to come
later).  The assignments will be worth 45% of the final grade. </p>
<p>Assignments are due at 8:30 of the morning of the weekday following the 
due date (so an assignment due on Friday will be picked up by the TAs at
8:30 Monday morning).  You may consult outside sources, such as textbooks,
web sites, as well as discussions with other students for general aspects
your assignment,
however <b>all</b> such sources <b>must</b> be documented.  Failure to do so
will result in academic dishonesty charges.  The details of your assignment
must be done <b>individually</b>.</p>
<p>Late assignments will be marked with a late penalty of 20% of the full grade
per day (unless you provide the instructor with a Course of Action for Missed
Work form delivered by the Associate Dean Office). Graded assignments and tests
will be returned during tutorial sessions.</p>
<p>The assignments will be marked by the TAs. Any request for remarking must be
first directed to the TA that has marked your assignment. After you have talked
to your TA and still believe that you deserve a higher mark, then you can
contact the instructor. When the instructor remarks an assignment or an exam,
all the assignment/exam questions will be remarked.</p>
<h4>Midterm</h4>
<p>There will be one midterm exam, closed-book.  It will take place on
<i>Monday, October 28</i> during class time, at a location to be announced
later.  It will cover material from the lectures, tutorials, assignments 
and the required textbook.  It is worth 20% of the final grade.</p>
<p> The midterm exam consists of two parts: a set of multiple-choice questions
and a few programming (written) questions.  For answering the multiple-choice
questions of the exam, the standard McMaster forms are used. The forms are
evaluated by the McMaster Optical Scanner. The multiple-choice forms are kept
by the instructor and can be viewed by student by request to the
instructor.</p>
<h4>Final Exam</h4>
<p>The final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar's office in the
usual way. It will be a three hours in duration and will cover the material of
the lectures, tutorials, assignments, and of the required textbook. It consists
of a multiple-choice part and a written part. The final exam counts for 35% of
your final score.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Policy Statements and Notes:</h3>
<h4>Policies</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Missed assignments or exams:</b>  
You must submit appropriate documentation (e.g. note from physician) to the
Associate Dean office. It is your responsibility to follow-up with the
instructor. A zero will be entered for the missed work unless the instructor
receives a <i>Course of Action for Missed Work</i> form delivered by the
Associate Dean Office before submitting the final grades to the faculty.</li>
<li>Questions on course material: ask them on Avenue, where they will be
answered faster.  Issues of a personal nature (relevant to the course)
can be sent via email; all other questions will be answered on Avenue,
even if asked via email.  This way all students in the class have the same
information on all items.</li>
<li><b>Tutorials:</b>  Note that some material covered during the 
tutorials will be on the midterm and/or final.</li>
<li>There will be bonus marks available on most assignments.  There will be
bonus assignments and other extra work which will count for bonus marks.</li>
<li>A remarking request of an assignment or midterm exam is considered by the
TAs and the instructor only if it is made <b>within the two weeks that 
follow the return date of the majority of the concerned assignment or midterm
exam.</b></li>
<li>The instructor reserves the right to require a deferred exam to be
oral.</li> 
<li>Calculators are not needed for this course and their use will
not be permitted during exams.</li>
<li>Material covered during class on the blackboard <b>will</b> show up
on the midterm and exam.</li>
<li><b>Suggestions on how to improve the course and the instructor's teaching
methods are always welcomed.</b></li>
</ol>
<h4>Discrimination</h4>
&quot;The Faculty of Engineering is concerned with ensuring an
environment that is free of all adverse discrimination. If there is a
problem that cannot be resolved by discussion among the persons
concerned individuals are reminded that they should contact their
Chair, the Sexual Harassment Office or the Human Rights Consultant,
as soon as possible.&quot; 
<h4>Course modifications</h4>
The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the
course during the term. The university may change the dates and deadlines
for any or all courses in extreme circumstances. If either type of
modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the
students will be given with explanation and the opportunity to comment on
changes. It is the responsibility of the student to check their McMaster
email and course websites weekly during the term and to note any changes.

<h4>Academic Dishonesty</h4>

<p>You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects
of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles
of honesty and academic integrity.</p>
<p>Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results
or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can
result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss
of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: <i>Grade of F
assigned for academic dishonesty</i>), and/or suspension or expulsion
from the university.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic
dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please
refer to the 
<a href="../../www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.html">Academic Integrity Policy</a>
[http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity].</p>

<p>The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:
<ol>
    <li>Plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.</li>
    <li>Improper collaboration in group work.</li>
    <li>Copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.</li> 
</ol>

    <p> Individual assignments have to be solved by one person only,
    <b>any</b> outside source, this includes asking other people,
    or using any books or information found on the web <b> has </b> to
    be documented. In complience with the senate regulations
    on academic integrity I remind you that:
     <b> People who let other people copy are as guilty as the ones who copy. </b>
    You are allowed to consult outside sources, meaning textbooks
    or the web, but <b> any </b> use of an outside source
    <b>must </b>be documented.  Similarly, group assignments must
    be solved by members of that group only, and the above policies
    apply as well.</p>
    <p>In the case the instructor or a TA
    has the impression that an assignment is copied, the instructor can
    ask the corresponding students to explain exactly how the assignment
    was prepared and take appropriate actions. </p>
<h4>Online Component</h4>
<p>In this course we will be using some online components. Students should be
aware that, when they access the electronic components of this course, private
information such as first and last names, user names for McMaster e-mail
accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in
the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used.
Continuation in this course will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you
have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with
the course instructor.</p>
