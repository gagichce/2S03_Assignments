    <H1>CS/SE 2S03 T1 2013/14<br /> Assignments</H1>
    <p>All assignments will be handed in electronically 
    using <a href="../../avenue.mcmaster.ca/index.html">Avenue</a>.</p>
    <ol>
	<li>Assignment 0 tests whether you can
	    <a href="assignments/a0/a0.pdf">follow instructions</a>.  You
	    will need the 
	    <a href="assignments/a0/HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld.java</a> 
	    file to complete the assignment.</li>
	<li>Assignment 1 tests 
	    <a href="assignments/a1.pdf">Basic Java skills</a>.  You
	    will need the contents of
	    <a href="assignments/a1.zip">a1.zip</a> file.
	<li>Assignment 2 continues to test your
	    <a href="assignments/a2/a2.pdf">Java skills</a>.  You
	    will need to refer to 
	    <a href="assignments/a2/a2links.html">a list of student ids</a>
            to get your personalized assignment.</li>
	<li>Assignment 3 is about
	    <a href="assignments/a3/a3.pdf">records and arrays</a>. </li>
	<li>Assignment 4 is about
	    <a href="assignments/a4/a4.pdf">Stacks, Queues and Priority Queues</a>. </li>
	<li>Assignment 5 asks you to complete the implementation of a small
	    <a href="assignments/a5/a5.pdf">Calculator</a>. 
            There is also some code (
	    <a href="assignments/a5/fora5.zip">fora5.zip</a> ) from which
            to start from. 
</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ol>
	    <li>Assignment 1: 
	    <a href="assignments/a1/A1soln.java">A1soln.java</a> and
	    <a href="assignments/a1/A2soln.java">A2soln.java</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li>Assignment 2.  Everyone's was a bit different, so I
	    post a sample solution -- you should be able to match the pattern 
	    with your own.  Starting from
	    <a href="assignments/a2/BadCode.java">BadCode.java</a>, one
	    proceeds through
	    <a href="assignments/a2/step1.java">step1.java</a>, 
	    <a href="assignments/a2/step2.java">step2.java</a>, 
	    <a href="assignments/a2/step3.java">step3.java</a>, and finally
	    <a href="assignments/a2/step4.java">step4.java</a>
	    </li>
	    <li>Assignment 3.  There are many different ways to do this
             correctly - <a href="assignments/a3/samplea3.zip">this</a> is
             just one of them.</li>
	    <li>Assignment 4 (will be posted after some extensions lapse).</li>
	    <li>Assignment 5 (will be posted after due date).</li>
    </ol>
